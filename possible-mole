Subject: Concerns about a Mole

I am writing to express my concerns about a potential mole within DefenseTech. As you know, our company deals with sensitive and confidential information, and any breach of this information could be detrimental to our business.

Recently, I have become aware of some suspicious activity that leads me to believe that there may be a mole within our organization. I have noticed some irregularities in the handling of our confidential data, and I am concerned that this information may be getting into the wrong hands.

I suggest that we take immediate action to investigate this matter and identify the source of the breach. We must take all necessary measures to ensure the security of our information and protect our company from any harm.

I recommend that we conduct a thorough internal investigation, and implement more stringent security measures to prevent any further breaches. Additionally, we may need to consider limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who have a legitimate need to know.

I understand that these measures may be inconvenient and may require additional resources, but I believe they are necessary to safeguard our company's future. Please take this matter seriously and take the appropriate steps to protect our information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Wolverine
