To: DefenseTech Management
From: John Wick
Subject: Competition from Jon Snow and Perry the Platypus

I am writing to express my concern about the recent news regarding our colleagues, Jon Snow and Perry the Platypus, securing major weapons contracts with the DOD. As someone who has worked for DefenseTech for many years, I am aware of the challenges that our company faces in this competitive industry.

I would like to suggest that we focus on improving our existing products and services, and work to make them more efficient and cost-effective. We also need to ensure that our products are of the highest quality, and that they meet the needs of our clients.

Furthermore, I believe that we should increase our marketing efforts, and work to build stronger relationships with our clients. By doing so, we can demonstrate our value and expertise, and build a strong reputation in the industry.

I also suggest that we work to identify new markets and opportunities, and develop new products and services that can help us to stay ahead of our competitors.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

John Wick
