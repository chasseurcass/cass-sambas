Greetings Agents,

I am pleased to announce that we have just received a new weapons contract from the DOD. While I cannot reveal too many details, I can tell you that this contract is going to allow us to develop some seriously cool new gadgets and weaponry.

As agents, we all know the importance of having access to the latest and greatest in technology. With this new contract, we will be able to stay ahead of the curve and continue to be the best secret agent organization in the world.

I cannot wait to see what our talented team of engineers and gadget-makers come up with next. Let's continue to make the world a safer place, one mission at a time.

Sincerely,
Perry the Platypus
